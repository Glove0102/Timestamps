1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,080
So today we're honored to swear in

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:06,080
Janine Piro, somebody I've known for a

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,120
long time and she's an incredible person

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,879
and incredible woman as our new interim

5
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:13,839
United States Attorney for the District

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,160
of Colombia. That's a big deal. And I'd

7
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:18,800
like to congratulate Janine and her

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,560
whole family. And we have Christine with

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:25,839
us and Alex I know is uh in a very very

10
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:27,198
important place right now. And uh the

11
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:29,920
two children but they're not children

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,840
anymore. And I've heard that uh

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,679
Christine, you're doing unbelievably

14
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:35,520
well and very successful at a great law

15
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:38,799
firm. So, it's great to have you with

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,440
us. Thank you very much. Over five

17
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:45,119
decades, Janine Piro, known by millions

18
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:47,439
as Judge Janine, has devoted her life to

19
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:49,679
the pursuit of justice, the defense of

20
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:51,519
freedom, and the fair, equal, and

21
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:54,558
impartial rule of law. And that's what

22
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,520
she's about. She was a great DA. I

23
00:00:54,558 --> 00:01:00,238
remember very well. She was as good as

24
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,879
anybody I've seen. She began a career in

25
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:04,798
1975 as an assistant district attorney

26
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:07,679
in Westchester County, New York, where

27
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,760
she prosecuted violent crimes. And that

28
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,200
was a serious prosecutor. And she went

29
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,960
after real criminals, not uh not fake

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,118
criminals like we seem to do today

31
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:21,039
nowadays, people that shouldn't be

32
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:23,519
prosecuted, including rape, murder, and

33
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,280
was tireless warrior. a tireless warrior

34
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:28,000
on behalf of the most vulnerable people

35
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,759
in our society. In that role, Janine

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,599
helped create one of our country's first

37
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,000
domestic violence bureaus. I think it

38
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:36,959
was the first Janine. And as its chief,

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,759
she revolutionized victim protection and

40
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:42,719
bold innovative policies like very few

41
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,400
people even thought of. In 1990, Janine

42
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,959
became the first female judge in

43
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,478
Westchester County history. And

44
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:50,478
following the year and by the way very

45
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:52,640
distinguished had an unbelievable

46
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:54,239
distinguished career. And in the

47
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,640
following years she presided over

48
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,158
numerous complex criminal cases. The

49
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,399
reason they were complex is that other

50
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,399
judges were not able to understand them.

51
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,920
They were called the complex cases. My

52
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,478
sister had them too. They always used to

53
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,719
give her the complex cases because other

54
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:11,120
people didn't understand them. Including

55
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:13,359
highstakes felony narcotics trials. Her

56
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,920
outstanding judicial record earned her

57
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,040
the honor of being named the number one

58
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:21,679
judge in 1990 by the Independent Fund

59
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:24,000
for Modern Courts. That's nationwide.

60
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,000
Outstanding judge. The following year,

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Judge Janine was elected Westchester

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
County District Attorney. Became the top

63
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,199
prosecutor for a jurisdiction that

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,039
included some of the largest suburbs in

65
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:37,518
New York City, including Yoners and

66
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:39,439
White Plains. It's a big deal. As

67
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,599
district attorney, Janine tackled

68
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:43,919
high-profile violent crime cases and

69
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:46,719
established one of the nation's most

70
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:49,518
successful cyber crime units to combat

71
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:51,840
online child abuse. She was way ahead of

72
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,360
a lot of people. They still aren't

73
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,039
there. If you get right down, I mean,

74
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,040
from what I hear, they're still not

75
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:59,439
there in many cases back there where we

76
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:01,598
come from. In addition to her stellar

77
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:04,959
legal career, Janine also excelled in

78
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:08,000
news media as her as you know and she's

79
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:10,479
become one of the most beloved political

80
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,560
figures through uh her time on

81
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:14,878
television because she's been very very

82
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,360
successful at thing called television.

83
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:19,120
She got out of uh what she was doing and

84
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,720
frankly she does them both great but

85
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,239
she's really to me she'll always be

86
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:23,919
known as a great lawyer and a great

87
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,599
prosecutor which is what she's doing

88
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:29,598
now. So Janine Piro I have no doubt will

89
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:31,598
be an exceptional US attorney for the

90
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:34,000
District of Columbia. One of the truly

91
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:36,878
most important positions in our country

92
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,878
of any position where she will restore

93
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:40,719
public safety in our nation's capital,

94
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:42,479
break up vicious street gangs and

95
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:45,120
criminal networks and ensure equal

96
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:47,518
justice under the law. You'll see very

97
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,080
very big improvements in the DC area.

98
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,759
That I can promise you. So I want to

99
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,680
congratulate Janine. I want to

100
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:57,598

[Applause]

136
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,120
Thank you, Mr. president and thank you

137
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,519
madam attorney general uh both my

138
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,560
friends for many

139
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:59,519
years long ago I went to law school to

140
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:03,439
study about justice and to bring justice

141
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:06,000
to victims of violent crimes women and

142
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:09,199
the elderly I fought to give them a

143
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,319
voice in a system that was both blind

144
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,879
and deaf to their

145
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:17,759
concerns I dedicated my heart and soul

146
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:21,199
to making sure that there was a system

147
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:24,319
that responded to them. My profile and

148
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,160
my prosecutorial successes garnered

149
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:30,160
public attention and my life took

150
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:32,639
unexpected t turns. Through all of this,

151
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,800
President Trump, you have remained as

152
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,960
steadfast as one of my earliest

153
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:41,478
supporters and champions. You never

154
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:44,638
wavered. You were always steadfast,

155
00:06:41,478 --> 00:06:47,519
trustworthy, and confident.

156
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,600
Today, Mr. President, you bring me back

157
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:52,719
to my

158
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:56,479
roots. And it is a larger arena, but no

159
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:59,039
less an arena where we need justice,

160
00:06:56,478 --> 00:07:01,519
where we need to send a message that

161
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:03,519
justice will be honored in the District

162
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:06,758
of Colombia.

163
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:09,680
And just last week here in our nation's

164
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:12,240
capital, two people on the brink of

165
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,199
beginning their life had hopes and

166
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:18,240
dreams that were never realized because

167
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:21,038
a coldblooded murderer made a decision

168
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,680
to shoot them down on the streets on a

169
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:28,639
cold, rainy night in our nation's

170
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:30,800
capital. This will not go without just

171
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,639
accounting.

172
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:38,520
My voice should be heard loud and

173
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:42,639
clear. No more. No more tolerance of

174
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:46,240
hatred. No more mercy for criminals.

175
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:48,800
Violence will be addressed directly with

176
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,598
the appropriate punishment.

177
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:55,280
And this city will again become a

178
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:58,240
shining city on a hill in an America

179
00:07:55,279 --> 00:08:01,758
that President Trump has promised to

180
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:05,918
make great again and will make safe

181
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:09,879
again. Mr. President, America thanks you

182
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:09,878
and I thank you.

183
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:20,959
Any

184
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:23,598
questions? Any questions?

185
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:27,399
Anything for you? You just want to talk

186
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:27,399
to him. I get it.

187
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:32,158
Thank you. She's going to be fantastic.

188
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,240
Thank you very much. They really all

189
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:35,918
there's no question because there's no

190
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,839
doubt. We have no doubt you're going to

191
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:39,519
be fantastic. Thank you, Mr. President.

192
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,279
Mr. President, Mr. President. Mr.

193
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,918
President. Yeah, Mr. President. Russia.

194
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:45,360
Mr. President, please. Um,

195
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:47,919
do you believe the Russians are being

196
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,240
disrespectful when they say that your

197
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:52,079
criticisms of Putin are simply an

198
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,639
emotional response? And do you still

199
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,480
believe that Putin actually wants to end

200
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:58,399
the war? I can't tell you that, but I'll

201
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,839
let you know in about two weeks. Within

202
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,559
two weeks, we're going to find out very

203
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:05,360
soon. Uh, we're going to find out

204
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:07,838
whether or not he's tapping us along or

205
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,200
not. And if he is, we'll respond a

206
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,720
little bit differently. But it'll take

207
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,200
about a week and a half, two weeks. We

208
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:17,200
have Mr. Mr. Witkoff is here is doing a

209
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,519
phenomenal job is uh dealing with them

210
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,240
very strongly right now. They they seem

211
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,159
to want to do something but until the

212
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,200
document is signed I can't tell you

213
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:28,838
nobody can I I can say this I can say

214
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,278
this that

215
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:34,720
uh I'm very disappointed at what

216
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:37,039
happened couple of nights now where

217
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,040
people were killed in the middle of what

218
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:40,719
you would call a negotiation. I'm very

219
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:43,120
disappointed by that. Very very

220
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,800
disappointed. Yeah. Please,

221
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,200
you've called for an end to the Ganda

222
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:48,799
war. Given the growing humanitarian

223
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,800
crisis and the decision of Prime

224
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:53,278
Minister Netanyahu to extend the

225
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:55,439
military operation, do you have any

226
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:57,278
frustration with his handling of the

227
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,080
situation of the war? No, we're dealing

228
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:02,958
with the whole situation in Gaza. We're

229
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,680
getting food to the people of Gaza. It's

230
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:08,239
a it's been a very nasty situation, very

231
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:10,239
nasty fight. October 7th was a very

232
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,799
nasty day, the worst that I think I've

233
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,000
ever seen. It was a horrible day and

234
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:16,399
people aren't going to forget that

235
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,159
either. So, we'll see how that all works

236
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,839
out. And Steve, would you want to say a

237
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:22,719
couple of words about Gaza because you

238
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:25,320
just have some information? Uh Steve

239
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,440
Woodco, do you want to come up for a

240
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,959
second? You might give them a little bit

241
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,040
of information as to what's happening

242
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:33,278
with Gaza and also Israel. We're having

243
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,799
some very good talks with Iran. We'll

244
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:38,078
find out whether that means anything,

245
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:38,078
but we're having good talks.

246
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:45,919
Congratulations. Well, m uh hi

247
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:48,399
everybody. I think we um uh I think that

248
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:52,078
we are on the precipice of sending out a

249
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:54,078
uh new term sheet um that hopefully will

250
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:56,479
be delivered later on today. The

251
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:58,479
president is going to review it. And I

252
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,360
have some very good feelings about

253
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:04,560
getting to a uh long-term resolution,

254
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:07,278
temporary cease uh temporary ceasefire

255
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:10,078
and a long-term resolution, a peaceful

256
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:12,000
resolution of that conflict. Mr.

257
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:13,838
President, you said having to do with

258
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,440
Iran. We're having very good talks with

259
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,360
Mr. President, you said yesterday that

260
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,160
Putin is playing with fire. What would

261
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,839
be the consequences for Russia if he

262
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:23,679
continues to if Russia continues? Well,

263
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:27,279
I'm not going to tell you exactly, but

264
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:28,719
uh the words speak pretty loud. Uh we're

265
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:31,919
not we're not happy about that

266
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,240
situation. I think we're uh we're doing

267
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:35,399
very well with Iran. I think we're doing

268
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,680
very well with

269
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:39,200
Gaza, but we are doing very well with

270
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:42,559
Iran. And I think we're going to see

271
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,160
some some uh something very sensible

272
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:46,319
because there are only two outcomes. You

273
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:48,000
know what the two outcomes? There's a a

274
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,399
smart outcome and there's a violent

275
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,958
outcome. and and I don't think anybody

276
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,720
wants to see the second, but I think

277
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:56,479
we're uh we've made a lot of progress

278
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,600
and we'll see. You know, they still have

279
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,360
to uh agree to the final stages of a

280
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,278
document, but I think you could be very

281
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,959
well surprised what happens there and

282
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:06,399
it'll be a great thing for them. They

283
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:08,879
could have a great country into the

284
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,799
future. Yeah. Mr. President, Elon Musk

285
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:13,919
in a television interview criticized the

286
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:15,599
one be big beautiful bill saying he was

287
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:17,199
disappointed it it didn't cut enough

288
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,800
essentially that undercut the Doge

289
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,959
efforts. What's your reaction to that?

290
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:22,399
Well, my reaction is a lot of things.

291
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:25,919
Number one, we have to get a lot of

292
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:28,399
votes. We can't be uh cutting, you know,

293
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:30,639
we need we need to get a lot of support

294
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,399
and we have a lot of support. We had to

295
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,240
get it through the House. The House was

296
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,679
uh we have no Democrats. You know, if

297
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,079
it's up to the Democrats, they'll take

298
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:40,000
the 65% increase. You know, if that

299
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:42,719
doesn't get approved, this country is

300
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,559
going to have a 65% increase in taxes

301
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,519
and lots of other problems, big

302
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:50,479
problems, almost bigger than that.

303
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:53,039
But we'll have a 65% increase as opposed

304
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:56,159
to the largest tax cut in the history of

305
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:58,719
our country. Uh we will be negotiating

306
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:00,639
that bill and uh I'm not happy about

307
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,240
certain aspects of it, but I'm thrilled

308
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,000
by other aspects of it. That's the way

309
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,320
they go. It's very big. It's the big

310
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,639
beautiful bill. But the beautiful is

311
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,800
because of all of the things we have. Uh

312
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:14,639
the biggest thing being I would say the

313
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:15,759
uh uh the level of tax cutting that

314
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,680
we're going to be doing. We're going to

315
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:19,439
make people really be able to We'll have

316
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:21,439
one of the We'll have the lowest tax

317
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,680
rate we've ever had in the history of

318
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,440
our country and tremendous amounts of

319
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:27,759
benefit are going to the middle inome

320
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,160
people of our country. Low and middle

321
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:31,439
income people of of our country. So,

322
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:33,600
we're going to see what happens because

323
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,279
the Senate, as you know, is negotiating

324
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,278
with us and they have to then go back to

325
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:40,200
the House and, you know, it's got a way

326
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:43,519
to go. But, uh, I I have to say Speaker

327
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:45,600
Johnson and Thun have done an incredible

328
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,560
job. John Thun has done a fant leader

329
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:51,360
Thun uh a fantastic job and they're

330
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:53,359
working together with me and others and

331
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,519
I think we have an amazing if we pull

332
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,120
this off remember we have zero Democrat

333
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,720
votes because they're bad people there's

334
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,879
something wrong with them you know

335
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,680
they're they'll let people pour into our

336
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:05,919
country single biggest problem is we had

337
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:08,239
21 million people pour into our country

338
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:09,838
probably higher than that and they're

339
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,879
people that weren't supposed to be here

340
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:15,320
and many of those people are bad

341
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:17,360
murderers drug dealers, the mentally

342
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,120
insane. They were closing mental

343
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,480
institutions all over the world. Not

344
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,759
South America, all over the world.

345
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,600
They're coming into our country and

346
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:25,278
we're getting them out. We're having a

347
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,120
hard time because some judges aren't

348
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:29,278
making it very easy for us. And it's

349
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,440
tough enough. They approve that. They

350
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:34,240
allow that to happen to our country. We

351
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,160
don't have one Democrat vote. And if I

352
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,240
were a Democrat, I'd be voting for this

353
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:40,958
bill and I'd get elected to any position

354
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:44,560
I want as a Democrat. They're crazy.

355
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:46,159
They're voting for a 65% tax increase

356
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:47,679
and they're only doing it for hatred.

357
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:50,078
They're not doing it for any reason.

358
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:52,159
They know it's terrible, terrible

359
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:53,838
politics in my opinion. But so we have

360
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:56,639
no Democrat votes. That means we have to

361
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,240
get almost all Republican votes. And I

362
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,759
think we're very close to doing that. I

363
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,198
think it'll be very successful. Yeah,

364
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:02,720
please. Mr. President, Wall Street

365
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:04,559
analysts have coined a new term called

366
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,879
the taco trade. They're saying Trump

367
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:08,399
always chickens out under tariff threats

368
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:10,240
and that's why markets are higher this

369
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,519
week. What's your response to that? I

370
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,198
kick out. Chicken out. Oh, isn't that

371
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,078
nice chicken out? I've never heard that.

372
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:21,439
You mean because I reduced China from

373
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:23,759
145% that I set down to 100 and then

374
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,680
down to another number and I said you

375
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:29,838
have to open up your whole country and

376
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:34,799
because uh I I gave the European Union a

377
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:36,240
50% tax uh tariff and they called up and

378
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:38,958
they said, "Please, let's meet right

379
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,600
now. Please let's meet right now." And I

380
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:43,278
said, 'Okay, I'll give you till Janine.

381
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,720
I actually asked them. I said, 'What's

382
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:46,799
the date? Because they weren't willing

383
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,320
to meet. And after I did what I did,

384
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:52,838
they said, "We'll meet anytime you

385
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:55,278
want." And we have an end date of July

386
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:58,199
9th. You call that chickening out?

387
00:15:55,278 --> 00:16:00,799
Because we have 14 trillion dollars now

388
00:15:58,198 --> 00:16:03,039
invested, committed to investing when

389
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:05,278
Biden didn't have practically anything.

390
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:06,799
Biden, this country was dying. You know,

391
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:08,480
we have the hottest country anywhere in

392
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,719
the world. I went to Saudi Arabia. The

393
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,560
king told me, he said, "You got the

394
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,278
hottest c. We have the hottest country

395
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:18,479
in the world right now. Six months ago,

396
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:20,399
this country was stone cold dead. We had

397
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,680
a dead country. We had a country people

398
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,399
didn't think it was going to survive."

399
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:26,719
And you ask a nasty question like that.

400
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,720
Uh it's called negotiation. And you set

401
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,720
a number and if you go down, you know,

402
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,120
if I set a number at a ridiculous high

403
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,278
number and I go down a little bit, you

404
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:39,440
know, a little bit, they want me to hold

405
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:41,278
that number, 145% tariff. Even I said,

406
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,680
man, that really got up. You know how it

407
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:46,159
got? Because of fentinol and many other

408
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:49,039
things and you added it up. I said,

409
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:51,919
where are we now? We're at 145%. I said,

410
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:53,679
woo, that's high. That's high. They were

411
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:54,799
doing no business whatsoever. And they

412
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,159
were having a lot of problems. We were

413
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:57,359
very nice to China. I don't know if

414
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:59,679
they're going to be nice to us, but we

415
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,759
were very nice to China. And in many

416
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:03,439
ways, I think we really helped China

417
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:06,000
tremendously because, you know, they

418
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,000
were having great difficulty because we

419
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,679
were basically going cold turkey with

420
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,078
China. We were doing no business because

421
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:15,439
of the tariff because it was so high.

422
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:17,279
But I knew that. But don't ever say what

423
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,519
you said. That's a nasty question. Go

424
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:22,480
ahead. To me, that's the nastiest

425
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:24,879
question. Wait a minute. Wait, wait. Go

426
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,720
ahead, please. President Zilinski says

427
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,960
he's ready to sit down with you and

428
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,360
Vladimir Putin in Geneva and it sounds

429
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,038
like General Kellogg is working on

430
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:34,879
preparations for that. Are you planning

431
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:36,879
to sit down with the two of them? Well,

432
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:40,480
I will if it's necessary. You know,

433
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,480
takes uh we have to uh I think I'm at

434
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,880
this point. I wish it would have been

435
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,400
that way a couple of months ago, but at

436
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,480
this point we're working on President

437
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,000
Putin and we'll see where we are. I

438
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,279
think we're doing fine, but we'll see. I

439
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,200
don't like what's happening. That's one

440
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:57,119
thing I'll say I don't like. When I see

441
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,880
rockets being shot into cities, that's

442
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:00,479
no good. We're not going to allow it.

443
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,240
You've always said that the war never

444
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,679
would have started if you were would

445
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,359
have never happened and it didn't. He

446
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,840
doesn't seem willing to do anything that

447
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:09,119
you want him to do. Do you still believe

448
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:11,720
that that he wouldn't have launched a

449
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:14,079
war? No. No. We would have never had a

450
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,839
war. We would have never had a war. If I

451
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:17,678
were president, if the election weren't

452
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:18,959
rigged, you wouldn't have had the war.

453
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,360
You wouldn't had the war. You wouldn't

454
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,120
had inflation. uh you wouldn't have had

455
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:24,879
October 7th. That would have never

456
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:26,798
happened because Iran was stone cold

457
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,600
broke. They didn't have any money to

458
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:31,679
give to Hamas or Hezbollah. You wouldn't

459
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:33,199
have had that Afghanistan most

460
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,559
embarrassing moment in the history of

461
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,000
our country. You wouldn't have had any

462
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:37,839
of it. You wouldn't have had inflation

463
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,319
because energy costs. Look what

464
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:42,879
happened. I brought inflation down to

465
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:45,038
practically zero. And all of the

466
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,240
groceries and all of the eggs and all of

467
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:48,319
the things that you've been hearing

468
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,400
about, they're back down. They're way

469
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:52,079
down from where they were. I did

470
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,640
something in four months that nobody's

471
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:56,159
seen. And I have to say in four months,

472
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,440
and I said it before, and everyone's

473
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,679
talking about it all over the world.

474
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,519
We've got the hottest country anywhere

475
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,600
in the world right now. We're the only

476
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:05,119
country anybody's even talking about.

477
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:07,119
All right. Please go ahead. What stops

478
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:10,319
you from imposing new sanctions on

479
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:11,918
Russia? Uh, only the fact that if I

480
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:14,159
think I'm close to getting a deal, I

481
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,600
don't want to screw it up by doing that.

482
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,400
Let me tell you, I'm a lot tougher than

483
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:20,959
the people you're talking about. But uh

484
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,200
you have to know when to use that if I

485
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,279
think it's going to hurt a deal. This

486
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,360
isn't my war. This is Biden's war,

487
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:29,519
Zalinsk's war, and Putin's war. This

488
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:31,918
isn't Trump's war. I'm only here for one

489
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:35,279
thing, to see if I can end it to save

490
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,799
5,000 lives a week and a lot of money.

491
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:38,319
The money being much less important

492
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:43,279
because I made that money. I went to

493
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:46,558
Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and UAE, and we

494
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:48,240
brought back $5.1 trillion.

495
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:49,519
So, I made that money in about two

496
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,279
hours, the money that we're talking

497
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:55,119
about. But it's still three, think of

498
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:57,879
it, $300 billion we've spent with no

499
00:19:55,119 --> 00:20:00,399
checks, no balances. They just send

500
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:02,960
cash. You can imagine what's happened to

501
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,600
that money. I never saw anything like it

502
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:09,120
in my life. But I'm more interested

503
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:12,798
because I picked up 5.1 trillion. And by

504
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:14,798
the way, got a beautiful big magnificent

505
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:17,119
free airplane for the United States Air

506
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:18,720
Force. Okay. Very proud of that, too.

507
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:21,519
They tried to say, "Oh, it's Trump's

508
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,519
airplane." Oh, yeah. Sure. It's too big.

509
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:25,200
It's frankly, it's it's too big. Much

510
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:27,519
too big. When do we expect that to be

511
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,279
the Air Force One? Well, it's here

512
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:32,319
already. Yeah, it's in the country. It's

513
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:34,079
being refitted for military standard.

514
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:35,519
How much will it cost to refit it? Oh, I

515
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:37,119
don't know. Whatever it is, a lot a hell

516
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:39,038
of a lot less than building a new one.

517
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:40,798
We're waiting too long from Boeing.

518
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:43,038
Boeing has got to get its act together.

519
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:45,440
Yeah. Sir, on Steel, this arrangement

520
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:46,798
that was just announced share. Is that

521
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,038
an arrangement you would consider for

522
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:50,720
Tik Tok as well?

523
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:52,558
Nothing to do with Tik Tok. Totally

524
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,319
different kind of a deal. We'll have to

525
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:56,399
get, you know, to do it properly, we'll

526
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:59,678
probably have to get China's approval.

527
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,960
China's never easy. China's never easy.

528
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,559
But I think, yeah, I think we'll be able

529
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,240
to save Tik Tok. I'd like to save Tik

530
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:07,558
Tok. I mean, Tik Tok was very good to

531
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:11,120
me. I won the young people by

532
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:11,879
37%. No Republicans ever won. And I won

533
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:15,038
by

534
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:18,840
37%. And Charlie Kirk will tell you Tik

535
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:21,919
Tok helped. But Charlie Kirk helped

536
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:23,678
also. Oh. Oh, he just happens to be

537
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,600
here. Look at him. He loves that we

538
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,120
mentioned that name, right, Charlie?

539
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:28,719
He's done great. And I appreciate all

540
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:31,519
the help. But with young people, we won

541
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,919
by 37%, Charlie. And you helped. But Tik

542
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:36,000
Tok was amazing. And he was the first

543
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:38,159
one. He said, "Get on TikTok." So I have

544
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
a little bit of a warm spot. I know I

545
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,679
shouldn't. They'll say quid proquo.

546
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,038
quid. Put him in jail for the rest of

547
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:47,038
his life. Quidd proquo. No, Tik Tok was

548
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:48,400
very good to me. I won young people. I

549
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:51,519
don't know if it was because of tick

550
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:54,320
tock, but it was uh it was something

551
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:56,720
happened. No Republican has ever won the

552
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:58,240
they call them young people. Young

553
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,759
people, you can define it a lot of

554
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,960
different ways, but I won every age

555
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:05,759
group in young people and it never

556
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:09,279
happened. And won by 37%. That's a lot.

557
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:11,200
Yeah. Back on back on Iran. Did you warn

558
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:12,639
uh Prime Minister Netanyahu against

559
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,519
taking some sort of actions that could

560
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:19,360
disrupt the talks there in a phone call

561
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:23,759
last week? Well, I'd like to be honest.

562
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:25,918
Yes, I did. Next question, please.

563
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:27,440
I did. Yeah. Senate Republicans want to

564
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,600
put It's not a warning. I said I don't

565
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,519
think it's appropriate. What What

566
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:32,959
exactly did you tell him? Did you said I

567
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:34,400
don't think it's appropriate. We're talk

568
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,600
we're having very good discussions with

569
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,240
him and I said I don't think it's

570
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:40,480
appropriate right now because if we can

571
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:44,720
settle it with a very strong document

572
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:47,679
very strong with inspections and no

573
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:50,960
trust. I don't trust anybody. I don't

574
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,559
trust anybody. So no trust. I want it

575
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,319
very strong where we can go in with

576
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:56,079
inspectors. We can take whatever we

577
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:58,879
want. We can blow up whatever we want

578
00:22:56,079 --> 00:23:00,399
but nobody getting killed. We can blow

579
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,080
up a lab, but nobody's going to be in

580
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,840
the lab as opposed to everybody being in

581
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:06,879
the lab and blowing it up, right? Two

582
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:08,480
ways of doing it. Um, yeah, I told him

583
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,080
this would be inappropriate to do right

584
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,480
now because we're very close to a

585
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:15,359
solution. Now, that could change at any

586
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,880
moment. Could change with a phone call,

587
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:19,599
but right now I think they want to make

588
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:23,240
a deal. And uh, if we can make a deal, I

589
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:23,240
save a lot of lives.

590
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:29,119
When do you think a deal could happen on

591
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:30,558
Iran? When? on which a deal with Iran

592
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:32,079
could happen. When Oh, I don't know. I

593
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:34,480
think over the next couple of weeks if

594
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:37,038
it happens. Yeah. On the um when could

595
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,120
the the administration resume the

596
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:41,038
interviews for foreign students visa?

597
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:43,359
When do you think your administration

598
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:45,440
could resume these interviews for on

599
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:47,119
what? For the foreign student visa.

600
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,840
Yesterday there was for the French

601
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:52,719
visas. For the foreign all the foreign

602
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:54,240
students. Oh, for the foreign visas.

603
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,839
What are you referring foreign visas

604
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,919
for? What are you talking about? for

605
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:59,199
colleges. College. Okay. So, you're off

606
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,919
of Israel. Now you're talking about

607
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,480
colleges, right? Okay. Uh well, we're

608
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:07,919
going to see. Look, Harvard has been a

609
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:10,720
disaster. Uh they've taken five plus, by

610
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:12,000
the way. Five billion dollars plus. Five

611
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,519
billion. Nobody knew that they were

612
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,200
making this kind. If we didn't do this,

613
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:18,240
nobody would have we would have never

614
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:21,038
found this out. Pam, they're taking5

615
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,640
billion dollar. And I'd rather see that

616
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:24,879
money go to trade schools. And by the

617
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,640
way, they're totally anti-Semitic at

618
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,200
Harvard, as you know, and some other

619
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,919
colleges, too, in all fairness to them.

620
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,919
And uh it's been exposed, very exposed.

621
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:36,038
And I think they're dealing very badly.

622
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:38,960
Every time they fight, they lose another

623
00:24:36,038 --> 00:24:41,519
$250 million. Yesterday we found another

624
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,679
hundred million. And they have, you

625
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:48,639
know, they have a fund 52 an endowment,

626
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:51,360
52 billion dollars. All right. They got

627
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,960
a lot of that from the United States.

628
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:55,000
And I think it's ridiculous. I think

629
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,278
this uh

630
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,000
everyone's coming up to me saying, "We

631
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:01,519
love the idea of trade schools." With

632
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,679
that kind of money and money from

633
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:05,759
others, but money from them, you can

634
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:08,600
have the best trade schools anywhere in

635
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:11,119
the world. You give them to Iowa,

636
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:13,359
Indiana, lots of good states, well-run

637
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:14,959
states, and you give them the money.

638
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:17,359
They can only be used for trade schools.

639
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:20,558
And they'll teach people how to build

640
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:22,158
motors and cars and AI. you know, the

641
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:25,839
AI, we're building plants. We're

642
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:27,919
building uh hundreds of billions of

643
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:29,918
dollars worth of AI plants already

644
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:31,278
started, many of them. We've never had a

645
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,200
boom like we're having now. You're going

646
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:35,440
to see it. Uh there's never been

647
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,240
anything like it. So, we're up to about

648
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,000
14 trillion dollars in investments.

649
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,240
There's never been anything even close.

650
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,119
You look at Biden, this guy, they had

651
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,440
people leaving as opposed to investing.

652
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:49,519
And they're doing it because of November

653
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,000
really November 5th and they're doing it

654
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:55,519
because of the tariffs. The tariffs have

655
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,200
been uh tremendous uh well I I can

656
00:25:55,519 --> 00:26:00,000
promise you and I have great respect for

657
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,720
the people at the European Union. They

658
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,278
wouldn't be over here today

659
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:07,440
negotiating if I didn't put a 50% tariff

660
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:09,000
on. The sad thing is now when I make a

661
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,360
deal with them it's something much more

662
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,839
reasonable. They'll say, "Oh, he was

663
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:16,558
chicken. He was chicken.

664
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:18,879
That's so unbelievable.

665
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:21,200
I usually have the opposite problem.

666
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,799
They say you're too tough. Mr.

667
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,278
President, on Harvard, there were some

668
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:27,918
Jew Jewish students protesting on campus

669
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:30,960
yesterday. They said they don't want you

670
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:33,278
making these huge cuts, cutting off uh

671
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,759
student visas to Harvard in their name

672
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:37,359
because Harvard has to show us a target.

673
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:39,919
Okay. Harvard has to show us their

674
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:43,759
lists. They have foreign students. about

675
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:44,919
31% of their students are foreignbased,

676
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:46,960
almost

677
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:48,720
31%. We want to know where those

678
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,480
students come. Are they troublemakers?

679
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,400
What countries do they come? And we're

680
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,278
not going to if somebody is coming from

681
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,120
a certain country and they're 100% fine,

682
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:58,960
which I hope most of them are, but many

683
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:00,879
of them won't be. You're going to see

684
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,960
some very radical people. They're taking

685
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,278
people from areas of the world that are

686
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,919
very radicalized, and we don't want them

687
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:10,319
making trouble in our country. So, uh, I

688
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:14,320
saw yesterday that in the middle in the

689
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:16,879
middle of, uh, the UK, there was a nice

690
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:18,960
young man. He wants to go back to school

691
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,720
at Harvard and he looked good to me, but

692
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,120
I want to check his past. But we want to

693
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,240
be able to see why, you know, these

694
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:28,000
countries aren't helping us. They're not

695
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:30,640
investing in Harvard and all of our we

696
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,880
are. So, why would 31% why would a

697
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,400
number so big? I think number one, I

698
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,559
think they should have a cap of maybe

699
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:39,120
around 15%.

700
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:40,720
not 31%. We have people want to go to

701
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:43,119
Harvard and other schools. They can't

702
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,880
get in because we have foreign students

703
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:47,278
there. But I want to make sure that the

704
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,278
foreign students are people that can

705
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:50,880
love our country. We don't want to see

706
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:52,480
shopping centers exploding. We don't

707
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,320
want to see the kind of riots that you

708
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,839
had. And I'll tell you what, many of

709
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:57,359
those students didn't go anywhere. Many

710
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:59,678
of those students were troublemakers

711
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:00,639
caused by the radical left lunatics in

712
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,960
this country. All right, one more

713
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,880
question. President, go ahead, please.

714
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,038
Will will you pardon the people who are

715
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,880
accused of conspiring to kidnap Michigan

716
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:10,960
Governor Gretchian Whitmer? I'm going to

717
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,200
look at it. I will take a look at it. Uh

718
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,759
it's been brought to my attention. I did

719
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,519
watch the trial. It looked to me like

720
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:19,038
somewhat of a railroad job. I'll be

721
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:20,879
honest with you. It looked to me like

722
00:28:19,038 --> 00:28:22,240
some people said some stupid things. You

723
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,799
know, they were drinking and I think

724
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,960
they said stupid things. But I'll take a

725
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:28,720
look at that. And uh a lot of people are

726
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,360
asking me that question from both sides.

727
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,440
Actually, a lot of people think uh they

728
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:36,879
got railroaded. A lot of people think

729
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:39,600
they got railroaded and probably some

730
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,679
people don't. No, one more. Go ahead.

731
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:43,839
How will the confrontation with Harvard

732
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,278
end? Do you you foresee? I don't know. I

733
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:47,278
don't I don't know. Harvard's got to

734
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:49,919
behave themselves. Harvard is treating

735
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:51,519
our country with great disrespect and

736
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,520
all they're doing is getting in deeper

737
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:55,359
and deeper and deeper. They've got to

738
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:57,200
behave themselves. You know, I'm looking

739
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:58,719
I'm looking out for the country and and

740
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,519
for Harvard. I want Harvard to do well.

741
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,360
I want Harvard to be great again

742
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:05,440
probably because how could it be great?

743
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:08,079
How could it be great when you have

744
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:10,798
Harvard announced two weeks ago that

745
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:13,278
they are going to teach remedial

746
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:15,599
mathematics? Remedial meaning they're

747
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:19,038
going to teach low-grade mathematics

748
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:21,759
like 2 + 2 is four. How did these people

749
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:23,319
get into Harvard if they can't if they

750
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:25,759
can't do basic

751
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:28,000
mathematics? How did they do it? I mean,

752
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:29,839
people with 1,600 on their boards don't

753
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,278
get in and they're getting they're

754
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:32,798
letting people in and they're bragging

755
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:34,480
about how they're teaching them basic

756
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:36,879
mathematics. Where did these people come

757
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,839
from? So, we have to look at the list

758
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,600
and and Harvard has to understand the

759
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:42,879
last thing I want to do is hurt them.

760
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:45,918
They're hurting themselves. They're

761
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:48,080
fighting. You know, Colombia has been uh

762
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:50,240
really they were very very bad what

763
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:52,720
they've done. very anti-Semitic and and

764
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,759
lots of other things, but they're

765
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,360
working with us on finding a solution.

766
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:59,679
And you know, they're taking off that

767
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:01,678
hot seat, but Harvard wants to fight.

768
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,360
They want to show how smart they are and

769
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,919
they're getting their ass kicked. Thank

770
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:07,839
you very much, everybody. Thank you.

771
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:10,240
Thank you guys.

772
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:12,000
Thanks, guys.

773
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,240
You are so great. Thank you. Thank you.

774
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,240
Good luck
