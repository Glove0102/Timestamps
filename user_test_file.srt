So today we're honored to swear in

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,120

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,560

00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,679

14
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:35,520
well and very successful at a great law

15
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:38,799
firm. So, it's great to have you with

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,440
us. Thank you very much. Over five

17
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:45,119
decades, Janine Piro, known by millions

18
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:47,439
as Judge Janine, has devoted her life to

19
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:49,679
the pursuit of justice, the defense of

20
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:51,519
freedom, and the fair, equal, and

21
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:54,558
impartial rule of law. And that's what

22
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,520
she's about. She was a great DA. I

23
00:00:54,558 --> 00:01:00,238
remember very well. She was as good as

24
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,879
anybody I've seen. She began a career in

25
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:04,798
1975 as an assistant district attorney

26
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:07,679
in Westchester County, New York, where

27
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,760
she prosecuted violent crimes. And that

28
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,200
was a serious prosecutor. And she went

29
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,960
after real criminals, not uh not fake

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,118
criminals like we seem to do today
